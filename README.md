# Hallmark

A design skill for AI coding assistants. Makes the UIs they generate look made, not generated.

## What it is

A single, opinionated skill that gives Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex a firm rule-set for typography, colour, layout, motion, microinteractions, copy, responsive behaviour, and structural variety. It refuses to emit the on-distribution defaults every LLM was trained into.

The differentiator: Hallmark insists on **structural variety**, not just visual variety. Two pages from two briefs should not share the same hero → 3-feature → CTA → footer rhythm. They should feel like different sites.

## Five verbs

| Verb | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| *(default)* | Build new UI. Asks for audience + use case + tone (skippable — the skill states what it inferred either way), picks a macrostructure, applies the rule-set, runs the slop test before handing back. |
| `hallmark audit <target>` | Score existing code against the named anti-patterns + structural sameness. Punch list, no edits. |
| `hallmark refine <target>` | Polish in place. Smallest possible diff. Preserves structure. |
| `hallmark redesign <target> [--mood <name>]` | Throw out the structure, keep copy + IA + brand, rebuild with a deliberately different fingerprint. |
| `hallmark study <screenshot>` | Extract the **DNA** from a design the user admires — macrostructure, archetypes, type-pairing role, colour anchor — and produce a diagnosis report. Optionally rebuild *the user's* content using the extracted DNA. Refuses paid templates and competitor pages. Names font roles, never font IDs. Never copies pixels. |

## What's inside

- **[`SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md)** — the routing file. Design flow (six steps, including `Step 2.5 · Check project memory` reading `.hallmark/log.json`), slop test (35 questions), output contract.
- **[`references/`](skill/references/)** — sixteen short, opinionated rule files: typography, colour, layout, motion, microinteractions, interaction-and-states, responsive, copy, anti-patterns, the 21 named macrostructures, the 36 component archetypes with variation knobs, the 6 primitive structure axes, the vision-extraction protocol for `study`, and three new files for hero work — `hero-enrichment.md` (when to add visuals to a hero, plus eight enrichment archetypes), `custom-craft.md` (how to hand-build CSS art, SVG, declarative animation, JS-driven motion, with Lottie demoted to last resort), and `assets.md` (sourcing canon for icons, brand logos, generated illustration via Nanobanana / Recraft, library illustration, app mockups, hero video, photography, abstract backgrounds).
- **[`site/`](site/)** — a self-demonstrating landing page. Hand-written HTML + CSS + ES module, no framework, no build step. **Sixteen themes** — Specimen, Newsprint, Atelier, Garden, Salon, Linen, Almanac, Midnight, Terminal, Brutal, Manifesto, Sport, Studio, Pastel, Riso, **Quiet** — that swap not just colour and typography but the page's hero archetype and footer archetype. Switching themes literally rebuilds the page. The palette is deliberately balanced across the warm / cool / neutral spectrum: warm-paper themes (Specimen, Atelier, Newsprint, Salon, Riso), cool-paper themes (Linen-cool-slate, Studio-cool-grey, Garden, Almanac, Pastel, Sport), neutral-paper (Brutal, Quiet), and three dark themes (Midnight, Terminal, Manifesto) — no single hue band dominates. The "07 · Examples" section ships with **eight** generation tests (under [`site/_tests/`](site/_tests/)) — each a self-contained HTML + CSS demo of the skill, with a real visual thumbnail on the gallery card.
- **[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)** — Tier 1, 2, 3 work plus an explicit "things to *not* do" list.

## What's distinct

- **One skill, five verbs.** Not eighteen commands.
- **Tone is a first-class decision.** "Clean and modern" is rejected. Pick an extreme.
- **Macrostructures over axes.** Pick one of 21 named whole-page shapes wholesale; the macrostructure stamp lives in the CSS comment, so the next Hallmark run picks something different.
- **Within-archetype variation.** Two Bento Grids should not be twins; each archetype has 2–3 picked-per-output knobs.
- **Microinteractions as discipline.** Silent success over celebratory toasts. Optimistic update + Undo over confirm dialogs. Hover delay 800 ms, focus delay 0 ms.
- **A 38-gate slop test** runs before every output. One yes fails the build. Three new gates added in v0.6.0: gate 36 (no horizontal scroll between 320 px and 1920 px — `html { overflow-x: clip }` is mandatory under any clipped-edge enrichment), gate 37 (decorative effects on text — highlighter bands, accent strokes, underlines — must be visually verified to sit in the right vertical zone, not at the baseline like a fat underline), gate 38 (interactive bars must declare `align-items: center` and `line-height: 1` — inheriting line-height fights vertical rhythm).
- **Project memory.** A per-project `.hallmark/log.json` records each run's macrostructure + theme + enrichment + brief summary. The skill reads the last 3–5 entries before picking, and writes a new entry after each build, so consecutive Hallmark outputs in the same project don't repeat shapes or themes.
- **Theme-diversification rule.** Two consecutive themes must differ on at least one of three axes: paper band (dark / mid / light), display style (italic-serif / roman-serif / geometric-sans / mono / display-condensed-italic / display-heavy / system-native / risograph), accent hue (warm / cool / neutral / chromatic). Specimen-fall-through is no longer the only diversification check.
- **Voice fixtures over LLM defaults.** Each of the 21 macrostructures ships with 2–3 example opening lines from real designer-engineer sites (Pentagram, Klim, Linear, Are.na, Resend, Lynn Fisher, Rauno Freiberg, etc.). Each of seven tones in `copy.md` has three voice patterns × five sample sentences. "Built for the modern team" is in the banned-phrases list.
- **Hero enrichment is opt-in, not a default.** A typographic-only hero is always acceptable. When enrichment is right, the skill picks from a six-tier hierarchy: typography only → custom-built CSS art → hand-built SVG → generated illustration (Nanobanana / Recraft) → library + customise → Lottie (last resort).
- **Microinteractions are default-on for SaaS-shaped archetypes.** Bento Grid, Stat-Led, Workbench, Marquee Hero, and Conversational FAQ pages ship with 2–3 small purposeful microinteractions (number reveal on stats, pricing card lift, marquee scroll, recommended-tier pulse, stagger reveal on testimonials) without the user having to ask. Editorial / Manifesto / Letter / Quote-Led pages stay still — stillness is the brand on those.
- **SaaS page sequence.** When the macrostructure is a SaaS-typical archetype, ship hero → social proof / logo wall → features → testimonials → pricing → FAQ → CTA → footer by default. Real prices, not "contact sales for pricing" on every tier; specific testimonials with role and company, not abstract job titles.
- **Wordmark may use a different display face.** A Geist-bodied SaaS page can set its wordmark in Fraunces; a Crimson-Pro-bodied compliance page can use IBM Plex Mono. Same-family collapse on Bento / Stat-Led / Workbench / Marquee Hero archetypes is the new "un-branded" tell.
- **`study` extracts DNA, not pixels.** Vision-extraction with refusal heuristics, type-role vocabulary (no font ID guessing), and a confirmation step before any code.
